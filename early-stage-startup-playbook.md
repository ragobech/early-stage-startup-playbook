## Using this Book
This book was written to provide people building products from nothing with a guide based on peoples experiences.

# Introduction
The pace of change in the world is occurring at an astromincal rate. The cost of building products and companies have reduced to merely peanuts. It has never been the best time to build a company. With that in mind, where does one begin? Many people have the aspiration to build a highly successful company but the reality is over 90% of companies fail.

I'm particulary interested in the advancement of human potential and condition. If we know something is going to fail. Let's fail at it fast so we can have people work on things that matter and help us progress in important areas that as a human race. After all, one of the scarcest resources we have are time and money.

I provide you an introduction to what I feel is the best way to see the future. It is to experience and create it using your unique knowledge, experience and strengths. It is not enough to build something, it is to build it knowing you existed and particpiated in it. 

My goal for this book is for you to develop a concrete set of mental models to take your early stage idea, validate if it's viable and develop steps to implement it, quickly.

## Startups
- An experiment being done before product market fit
    - Has this experiment been done before?
- It has a problem hypothesis: it is a guess of what you think the problem your target set of users possess
- It has a solution hypothesis: if you've successfully identified the problem, it is a guess of what you think the solution to the problem is. (Note: you will only know if the solution that you've built is the right when when you receive customer feedback and people are actually payinf for the product)
- You have identified a customer and a user that solves a problem for them that the customer is willing to pay for.

## Product/Service
- A way to built to solve a need or problem provided to the end user or customer.
- Products are means to an end and a conduit to the end user to help them fulfill their need

## Company
A company is a group of people that sell a product or service for a profit.


# The Start of the Journey

## Problem Space
- The problem space is a virtual space where a unique set of triggers {x, y....} cause a pain point {z} that lead to a problem {p} that are uniquely defined by characteristics  {a, b, c....}
- Understanding & Observing the Unique Problem Space You're in.
These can be anything from pain points, desires, or jobs-to-be-done.
- Who does the problem effect?

## Solution Space
- The solution space is a virtual space where the charactersitics {a, b, c,...} are solved by a solution S {j,k,l.....}


## Market Space
- The market space is the set of all buyers and sellers in a specific Market

Determining how big the market is for your product

The market determination is more of an art than a science Coming up with a market to determine how big the market it is today as well as how it will grow in the future is challenging depend on who you ask. 



## Consumer vs. Business

### Consumer
1. Prioritize building an audience
2. Start by understanding your audience's actual needs
3. Establish a unique voice & be authentic
4. Go out of your way to deliver value


### Business
1. Prioritize building building for a customer
2. Start by understanding your customer's actual needs
3. Establish a unique voice & be authentic
4. Go out of your way to deliver value


I'm willing to pay currency value because
- I have higher priority jobs to do
- It allows me to do the thing I'm doing with more efficiency so that I can do more of it
- I need it to conform to a regulatory requirement
- Be part of a community
- Be part of an experience





Example:

Problem Space - Customer - Google
- Customer Trigger: A customer is wishing to purchase a item to solve their need or problem.
- Business Trigger: A business owner looking to make more money by distribution their website to sell their products and/or services.
- Pain point: Make more money
- Problem: A business owner needs to drive distribution to their business to make more revenue
    -  Purchase more products
- Solution: 
    - The fastest and most relevant search to easily take human language keywords to display the business owners product page for the usr to find and purchase

Problem Space - Lens
- Trigger: An entrepreneur wants to understand more information about a market
- Pain Point: I need to find information on something specific and finding it is very difficult and time consuming.
- Problem: I want to know if this information fits this criteria and get peoples opinions
- Solution:
    - The community gets incentives for controbitnuting answers to a lens.

1. Create lens
- create


## Choices in Scarcity
- What choices do people make in the act of scarcity? What do they prioritize?
- How to build products with limited resources

## Windows of Opportunity
You need to develop systems to resolve the problems you have 


KPIs
- new users

- Consumer businesses(tarpit) - what good looks like
- What the bar is?
- Evangelizing
- Generate Ideas
- Obtain Feedback
- Validate Idea
- Communicate the Idea
- Validate the Idea
- Build the Idea
- Close a paying customer

This will be a success if
- A and B and C and D and E and F are true
- If people understand how lens can benefit them
- If people want to create lens

But, you may ask, why am I deserving to write in this topic? What is inquien about me? There are other people that can probably write about this topic as much as I can...it's true. So I decided ot build a company alongside this book to show you my unique experience.

TL;DR: Build things that customers want, better than anyone else. 

## What do customers want?
Understanding the problem domain and what customers want is one of the hardest parts of starting a business. 

## Identifying Opportunities
The Types of Opportunities
-  Gaps In Markets
-  New Technologies drive cost curve lower
-  New Regulatory decisions
-  Consumer behaviour changes
-  Creative ideas

## Building a Hypothesis
- Thought Leaders will create a lens to classify information that is important to them
- They will take the time to do this because it's their space and they want to show they are thought leaders in that space
    - User Segment 1 - Thought Leaders in specific industries with a unique perspective.

## Specificity Matters
Failure breeds ambiguity
Success breeds specificity and Failure gets invalidated quicker.

## Communicating what you do and why you do it

1) Set Context about the Customer, Idea, Product, and Market
2) Set Pain Point/Problem/Opportunity
3) Set Destination / How big market can be
0) What happens if people don't use your product?
4) Set Where you are at today
5) Set Your Solution / What we do
6) Set Why you and your team are the ones to solve it.
7) Set Why it hasn't been done yet.
8) What insights can you obtain about your idea

Example for Lens.app

1) Finding 
1. Customer: Who is the customer and what do you know about them?

2. In one sentence what do you do?



Idea: Getting an organized point of view from someone
Why is this important:
    - Points of view from people take time to build and materialize and not comprehensive, and can be incomplete
    - Points of view lead to costly decisions

What happens if people don't use Lens?
- People who have established lens' have faster access to information on key decisions and as a result can make higher quality decisions
- Takes longer time
- People won't have access to information that is uniquely built on Lens by creators, users
- Lens are up to date and recent - not static
- Build a community about peoples perspectives

## Actors

- Creators
    - People who create a lens

- Moderators
    - People who have the ability to modify and update a lens

- Consumers
    - Viewers of lens'

Make lens scarce



Types of Lens


Insight: A filtered lens from an experienced person is higher quality than a default list.
- Who are they
- What perspective do they have?
- What can I get from them?

Quickly validate or invalidate your hypothesis

## How to test your hypothesis
- If people don't want to use your product, what is the minimal piece of functionality you can build to solve the problem your user has?
- 


## The Idea - Back to Basics
Why does the world need your product? Why should it exist? You can solve a problem for one person once, create value, make a little money and go on your way. Why do you need to build a product or company? A good answer to this question is that the problem is so big enough and impacts a large amount of people that if it doesn't get solved, people die, get hurt or in pain or don't realize their true human potential. Why are you the one to solve? The good answer to this question and that you are the only one in this world that has the skills, ability and experience to do so. 

Our human brains tend to overcomplicate situations yet. humans can be extremely simple and straightforward but the potential business owner is not paying attention, listening or identifying what matters to the customer user.

With being so obsessed with your customer and tied to their hip, asking the right questions, you can determine if your customer has a big enough problem that they are willing to pay for.

Company building. You have to commit to the long-term vision of the future. You have to believe Short-term thinking vs long-term thinking increases the chances 
Another good iquestion is why does you product need to exist in 10 years?

## We are similar but we are different.

## We are similar in the sense 
- People generally want to be successful 
- People want to take care of their family and friends
- We all have our own biases
- Loss aversion: We err on the side of protecting what we have.

## We are different in that we prioritize different things
- We want the world to 
- we have certain kinks/nuances that allow us to see the world differently.
- We all have our own biases towards different things
- The Founder
- Why do Founders build products and start companies?
- It's one of the hardest journeys to go on: it's dangerous, loneley, stressful, emotional, most likely end up in failure or poor outcome. Could set you back finanncially.  But with all the doomsday scenarios, people still decide to go on the journey because they feel the world will be beffter off because of what value they can provide to the world.

We over complicate thigns because of options, Because of options, it leads us into too much decisions. If we remove options, we are better along with being able to focus on succeeding at the task at hand.

## How to reduce the time it takes to get to the answer you want
The Proposition to Reality & Truth Gap

Good:
- Child Reading App
    - Problem: Efficacy of reading outcomes in children from 4-14 is low. Distractions, ipad, cause children to not read as much as they could as well as it is isolated.
    - 37M amount of children between ages 4 - 10 - in US
    - Established companies  -> Note of validation of  existing pain since other companies are trying to solve the same problem
    - What about your service that you do the best at that will motivate and encourage your demographic to use it?
    - Demand: 
    - Solution:

Bad:
- Lens filter app 
    - to socially filter information from the crowd
    - Problem: People make poor decisions and need the crowd to supplement their understanding and decisions
    - They limit perspective
    - XM have trouble filtering information and making a decision
    - Demand: (Who)
    - Pick 5 groups of people that this can help(high urgency and frequency):
    Urgency
        1. Startup builders who want opinoins about building a company

Frequency
    - Who is one person you can find that will use this that you can gain insights about the current market?
    - What are the use cases for this product
    - Why do you think this product is valuable?
    
    - Why now? (Timing)
        - I just discovered the idea
        - If you waited 10 years to build it, would people still care?

What is the truth?

## Truth Board:
0. You haven't defined the problem you're solving, clearly.
1. You have not defined a unique value proposition
2. Your product is not validated.
3. You have not identified a reason for users to return to your product and use it frequently.  
4. You do not have a customer paying for your product 
5. You have not established a product market fit
6. You don't have a compelling reason on why a compettior can't copy your service easily.

What's on your truth board?

Build and join lenses.

## How it works

Turn ideas to revenue

- Your buyers who are not paying have the money to pay you, they just choose not to.
-
-

-
-


## Business model
- hide information

## Reality
- Difference between reality and your assumptions of reality
- Is it an attractive market to enter? If so, why?
- Going deeper by asking why?


## Internal Rating System
- Develop an internal rating system for yourself, this will determine the quality of decisions and work that you and your team produce.
    - Inadequate
    - Adequate
    - Superior
    - Market Leading
    - Industry Leading

## Market Timing
There must be a reason why your product needs to exist today…right NOW. What is the current trend on why your product didn’t exist years ago and why now is the right time? What is it about NOW that makes things different? Is it the right time to be building this and why?

What are the characteristics that make the timing climate the best for your product currently. Advanced technology? Unique insight?

## Focus

Winning a small set of users and getting them to love your product is much better than getting a large number of users who somewhat like your product. By focusing,you can leverage the small set of users that you can relate to and conduct targeted research against them

People who love your prodcut
People who have the problem but infrequently 
People who don't want to use your product.

## Focus comes in 
- The problem you’re solving
- The people you’re targeting
- Ie I’m building a finance tool for SaaS companies to automate payroll with no full-time Finance staff within the United States
- you must do one thing really, really well. Otherwise, what are you doing?

## How to focus?
- People who have the largest problem and have the most likely motivation to pay to have the problem go away,
- If no one will pay it is a sign that the value you're providing does not exceed 
- Dominatation of 10
    - Who are 10 people that you can get to use your product that you can get 
    - Who is one person you can 
- Empathy
- Understanding your customer intimately
- Articulated and unarticulated needs of the user

## What matters
Your goal is to determine the failure points as quickly as possible to determine the viable of the idea you want to pursue. Here are 5 things that you can validate quickly to determine if an idea is worth pursuing.

Note: The below is not easy, but required to determine if you're on the right track.

1) Will someone pay $0.01 for it? (will they take their wallet out and pay - this demonstrates a strong enough pain and willingness to pay)
2) Given that people don't want to use your product. What is the main benefit they are getting from it?

## Question,  -> Answer,  Decision, Action

Will people create a lens to classify information?

Examples:

Provide examples of this
- List out the common problmes that poeople have in building products

## Common Problems
1. They don't understand the market enough
2. They don't know if people will pay for the offering

## The Known vs. Unknown Market
wn market vs the known market?
An uknown market is a hypothesis, you should not treat it as reality.

The known market is the market that you have 

## Signs you're product and company are not ready for prime time: 
1. You can't articulate the problem
2. You don't understand the market
3. It requires a lot of events to be true that are unlikely or have low probability.
4.   

## Exercise in segmentation:
    What are the unique attributes of your potential customer base?
    Thius is an area where people get extremely wrong.
    - They say...everyone need theirs product.

## Signal vs Noise
        - Signals tell you positive and negatives things about the information you need on what you're building
        - The Reality of the situation is data that you require to make full judgements about your business does not exist
    - Information and data will be incomplete, skewed, misprespsnative
    - What to do to get successful signals
## Noise
    -  Be aware of what information is noise and does not matter ot what you're building...you can easily interpret a wrong fact or figure to negativitely influence your decisions
    -  Noise comes form possible competitors, etc.
    - The Minimal Viable Segments
    - Failing 

## Understanding of the "Market"
    - A Market is simply the aggregate of buyers and sellers. If you co-located everyone and everything in the world into one location and each station was selling a product/service, you would have all the markets in the world together.  But because the world is much more complex than this, there is a push and pull of market dynamics.
    - Markets 
    - It is much easier and simpler to take an existing market  and segment itThe market you choose to enter 


## Types of Markets
- Regulated Market


## Buyers
    Can you think about the last ten things you bought? Why did you buy them...I'll give you an example (B2C)
    (B2C)
    - My mortgage
    - A coffee
    - A gift

    (B2B)

## Sellers
    - 
    -
    - 

## Using Data
Live in the moment data vs. static data....they are different

Good data


Bad data


Do not build until you validate. You will save money and time doing things that aren't worth it.

2) The Customer
    - Can you clearly articulate the problem that your customer has?
    - Who has the problem and how many people are there?
    - How are these people solving the problem today?
    - How superior is your product that will motivate them to switch?

2) The Product
    - Why build a product?
    - Product Market Fit vs Product Market Channel Fit
    - Iteration and Feedback Loops
    - Scarce resources
    - Failing 
    - The Hackers Mindset
        - A hackers mindset is a way of using creative solutions to solve problems. BEing persistent with the problem is . Redefining the problem in how to attack it, think of 
        - How do you hack this website?
    - Cohorts of users
        Cohorts are a good way to segment user bases around groups and time. Why people buy things in the last 3 months could dramatically be different in the next 3 months. It is important to segment buying behaviour into cohorts to understand trends and buying patterns to be able to predict and plan for the future
    - Net retention rate
    - Pricing Discovery
        - Cost Plus
        - Value Based

## Determining the value of your product to your potential customer

When you value something, you consider it important, worthwhile, and something to possess. When people determine the value of your product/service it is in relation to the specific problem you are solving for your user and the characteristics involved with it; in other words the WHY? Why is it valuable? Does your product save people time? How much time? If people value their time, they will value the thing that protects and saves their time.
Value substituation is important and the time to value ratio. Time: Value - ratio - if you save me 1x time here, and I have the potential to generate 5x revenue by saving my time to do something that accomplishes Y, I value that tremendously. I find that related to the worth of my time plus the amount of potential reward. 

- Value has a trigger
- Value is relative
- Value is subjective
- Value is time-bound
- Value has priority

To determine value to your customer, you will need to understand how important and how urgent it is to them to resolve the problem and how your solution fits in.

Example: A bed is valuable. Provides comfort while I sleep.

Trigger: I need to sleep every night.
Sleeping on a nice comfy bed is highly valuable than going to a park. 
Some people value different things about a mattress
Time-bound: The value I put on my current bed is 2-3 yrs until I need to get a new one.
Priority. I prioritize my sleep, as a result, I highly prioritize buying a valuable bed because the consequneces of sleeping poorly or not enough has implications to my well being the next day.
     
## It's not money, you should think about the currency of value.

The currency of value is a way for your customers to tell you that what you're doing creates value for them. People and Companies preserve and make conscious decisions about the currency of value because it ensures their survival and they utilize it to obtain a higher return for the future.

Value currency has contextual information in it about priority of pain point for the customer.

What do customers do with value currency?


### 1. Spend on Necessities and Survival

### 2. Invest for the future

### 3. Research

### 4. Make efficiencies to save time and money

### 5. Distribution

### 6. Spend it on Cost of Doing Business


- 
- I think we confuse value with value currency.
- Things can have value but enough for customers to pay.

Value without currency is not anyhting.

## Inflections
- Regulatory
- Cultural
- Technology

# Types of businesses
- Lifestyle
- Bootstrapped
- Venture Scale Business 


# Comparables
- It's important to understand the comparables in the space. 



3) The Company
    - Why build a company?
    - Building Companies are hard
    - Making Impact
    - Understanding your mission, vision and values
    - Getting people to buy into the vision
    - Building Teams 
        - Short-term vs Long-term
    - Team Formation 
    - Hiring
        - Where to find people 
    - Culture
    - Funding & Raising Money
    - The functions of a company
        - Customer 
        - Product
        - Revenue Generation
        - Sales
        - Operating Costs
    - Failing 

    What's the biggest problem you have that drives the most impact, that if solved will reduce the risk of failure?

# Your pathway to success
I hate to say it but your customers don't want your product. They never did. The fact that they have to come to your website, create their accounts, sign in...etc. It's a hassle. A product or service is a means to an end. Your customer or users just want to meet their goals or objectives. Many product builders and founders get caught up in how smart they think they are. At the end of the day, the customer/user just cares about getting a certain job done or achieving their goal. Help them do that in the most easiest and cost effective way possible and they will keep coming back.

In describing the value you can bring to your users and customers, you should change your vocabulary on how you reference and describe them.
At such an early stage your vocabulary should change to be within the customer context. For example:
- Fans want cheaper food and seats closer to their favourite player
- Instead of ....we're changing the seating arrangements in the stadium to have players closer to their fans.

Identify Small Experiment. Ship. Learn. Repeat.

# Your uniqueness and powers
- Document what makes you uniquely good at something and powers

- I am good at building early stage products and seeing things through.
- I like to think of ideas from scratch and see them to fruition.

# Keep it simple
- I always look at how we can simplify things, move fast, iterate, fail, learn and succeed.
- There are many wways to keep things simple ie:
1. Task A can take 8 hours to do but solve 80% of the problem
2. Task B can take 10 hours to do but solve 70% of the problem
3. Task C can take 24 horus to do but solve only 25% of the problem



## Time in Startups is not Equal
- How you should think about the time you spend working on things.


## Customer Obsession
How are you going to get customers?
What triggers your customer to want to use your product?
- How frequent does your customer experience their problem that triggers the need for your product?




## Skills to work on 

Get good at asking extremely good questions at a rapid rate.

A great question answered extremely well leads 
A poor question leads one to a series of ambiguity, unanswered information and poor outcomes.

Product/Service
- 

## PMF
Success == Find qualified people that suffer from the problem your product solves and find enough value in YOUR product that they are willing to pay money to make their problem go away.

That's your target market and product market fit(PMF).
Finding PMF is EXTREMELY HARD.


## What makes you unique?

If one had asked me that question early in my career, I would be lost for an answer.
- What are you uniquely good at?
- What are you exceptional at?
- What is the one thing in this world that you're the best at?
- Note, this a very important question because if you compete with peoppel in startups that are better than you in skill, expertise and knowledge, it will be hard for you to beat them. Understanding what you are uniquely good at puts YOU in the drivers seat and YOU with the unique advantage.

## Tough questions:
- What do you do?
- Are you building something that someone wants?
- Are you building something that someone will pay for?
- Is there enough people willing to pay for your product/service to make it a sustainable business?
- Are you able to generate the product at a cost to make the business sustainable?
- Can someone else produce what you're doing as equal or better than you?
- Do you have a specific unfair advantage that protects you from competition? 
- Is your user adoption metrics predictable?
- Is your revenue predictable?
- What about your business gives it staying power for the next 10 years?
- What set of choices will you make that are differebt from the players in the market?



## What Not to do
- Build things that people don't want
- Spend too much time building things without feedback from your end users
- Make assumptions about things without getting data 
- Make assumptions about things without getting insights
- Spending too much time in your head 
- Be ambigious or unclear in your statements and reasoning

## Tangible
- Find a person that fits your target userbase and talk to them as soon as possible
- Develop a set of questions to ask them to better your understanding.
- Making High Quality Decisions fast and early.

The Seven Buying Reasons

They buy to:

- To make more money – think investment advice or business coaching
- To feel better – think massage, medical services
- To have better relationships – think counseling or personal development work
- To save time or to improve performance – A lot of business decisions are based on this especially if you are a solo operator. I outsource a fair amount because it’s more efficient to save my time for money generating activities
- To experience – think holidays, extreme sports or luxury goods.
- To look better – this could be to physically look better or it could be related to status.
- To protect themselves – this could be preventative health measures or a service such as insurance.

## Business
- After there is product-market-fit, there is a business
- A product built that serves a customer that is willing to pay

## Company

1. Startups are hard because you are creating things from scratch that hasn't been done before and the path to doing so is not clear and straight forward.
2. Startups fail because the people operating and involved with them sometimes do not have the same goals, motivaitons and intentions
3. Inexperience in startups cause people to fail
4. Optimization for 
    - Customer discovery
        - Why personas suck
        - Talking to people and getting direct feedback
    - Building
        - Early Product Building
    - Shipping
    - Understanding
    - Selling
5. Startups are not for everyone. 
   You should not start or work for a startup if:
    - You can't commit a large % of your time > 90% to the startup
    - Be incessently motivated to accomplish the mission of the company
    - If you just want a job to go to and from
    - Unable to learn fast and adapt 
    - Be able to deal with high pressure environments.
6. Uniquely well
    - What do you and your team possess that you feel only you can build?

## Asking the right questions...

A good question, well formed can advance and filter your solution to a problem

Here are some good an difficult questions:

- What about your product that do your potential customers not realize they need?

- "How upset would you be if we took away the product from you after using it?"

BUT

Not all questions are the same - so introducing weighted questions will help one understand the importance of what it solves

# Building your Sequence of Problems to Solve

->Identify a Segment
-> 

# Ownership and Accountability
- You are kidding yourself if you ask somoene who didn't found the company and who doesn't have signifcant quity in the cmopany to care through a certain point about hte company
- In general people are professional enough to do what's reasonable to complete their job to stay employed
- It requires an incentive mechanism and founders to take the company to a different level


- ACCOUNTABILITY NETWORK
- What's the most important problem you have that you need to address with urgency?
- Sounding board to het advice ,information and guidance

Messaging
- How you talk matters
-


What I hope you get out of this book is a way to think about building great products that customers want that only you and your team can uniquely deliver. Let's begin!

## What Matters

1. That you can identify opportunities and execute on them
2. You will have successful and unsuccessful initiatives
    - Ensure the unsuccessful initiatives are short and do not kill your company
3. Experimentation is high / figure out what works and what doesn't
4. Operate with urgency - you do not know how long you will have to be in the game
5. Stay in the game
6. Demonstrate demand for the product 

## You should start or work for a startup if:
- Passionate about solving a problem and it won't be getting solved
- Identify a signficant gap in the market that you feel you and your team has the expertise to bridge

## Early founding skills
Do you have what it takes to start and build a company?

- Risk taking...sacrificing the present for the future pay off
- Going with ambiguity and unknowns
- Learning quickly
- Adapting to new situations
- Selling
- Telling a story
- Execution
- Strategic creativity
- Thinking critically
- Dealing with rejections
- Betting on yourself.


## The size of the opportunity
- is your idea worth pursuing?
- 

## When to shut a product down
- Your customer doesn't have the problem you think they have.
- It doesn't solve the problem your
- Low interest and demand
- Market timing
    - peoples priorities are different and it's on a lower rank
- Market is not big enough
- Not able to be profitable or it will take too long
- Run out of motivation

# Founders
- The individuals that build the company have a vision of the future. Building a product and business is a way to create the future. When you look at the successful founders of our generation, they possess a unique set of skills and characteristics that have driven them to success in their market and industry
- A unique insight about a market, product, customer that fills a gap 
- Domain Expertise in the founder, why is this founder the right person to be solving this problem?
- For the future to become reality, a number of "Ands" must usually come to fruitiion in order for your successful outcome to materialize.
- Committment to their craft
- Being ahead of the game and your competition


## Types of Founders

- Legal Founder
- Product Founder
- Technical Founder
- Sales Founder
- People Founder

What you should be focused on as a founder
- getting the most insights about the idea
- selling to people
- doing what you can to invalidate the idea
- understanding what you're good at vs. what you're not good at.

I'm good at:

- Indie - Software Developer
- Management + Executive
- Writing
- Startups
- Early Stage Startups
- Entrepreneurship
- Passionate about building new companies from nothing because it is a way to design and build the world

It's only fitting that I've built a new startup and I'm writing about how to help others build startups.

Performance Based Projects
- Identify your target market (the characteristics of your buyers) in 15 days
- Identify what your buyers are doing right now and who they're going to - 5 days
- Invalidate your idea in 30 days






We try to do too many things as a founder, lack of identifying a concrete objective that matters and gets to the crux of the problem is a recipe for failure. In my opinion is better to take longer to get to a higher quality outcome than to take shortcuts and get to a lower quality outcome.


## What's next so - you have an idea that are convinced that works

- Test, Test, Test
Ways to test
1. Build a splash page with isgn up and get ads to drive people signing up
2. Reach out to your target market, offer them something of value and get to the bottom of your assumptions


- You know it when you know it..meeting product market-fit
- If you have to ask, you don't have PMF.


## Good reasons to start a business
- The world requires a solution in space to make it better off and you're able to fill that gap
- social impact 

## Bad reasons to start a business
- I want to make money
- ego or prestige
- lack of opportunities
- its the cool thing to do


## Urgency vs Importance


## Speed of Learning



## Who to target
- early adopters
- are people who are likely to try and experiment with new things
- things don't need to be perfect
- innovators
- like to be on the cutting edge 

## Where to find these people
- reddit
- communities

Day 0
- The first days of product building has the founders passionately researching, communicating, 

Day 1
- The first days of product building has the founders passionately researching, communicating, protoyphing, talking to people on the new idea that they just discovered. The optimism that flows in this phase is like eupohoria. You suddenly discovered the "Solution" to solve all of lifes problems and if only you build it as soon as possible and get it to market, you will be a king and make a lot of money.
- Suddently after the first initial thoughts, those ambitions start coming back to earth and reality sits in.


The early days

Everyones goals are different...what you see on the outside and what is on the inside is usually different.
- Do you care about making a change in this industry?
- TBD

Bet on technical insights that help solve a big problem in a novel way that yields a superior product with business profitability.

Founders
- Identifying the opportunities
    - Will this opportunity have significant long-term potential?
    - 
- Drive vision for the company on a consistent basis
- Drive Sales
- Hiring
- Unique Insight
- Research


Founders basically have to do everything at the beginning: 
- Drive Product strategy and vision
- Make Sales & Revenue
- Strategy 
- Customer
- Secure Funding
- Financial Management and Accounting
- Culture
- Building the product (Technical Founder)

# Cases

## Case 1: Building Block 1

A platform for in-person/virtual group therapy. 

Funding for mental health startups rose 139% and hit $5.5 billion in 2021. Despite all of this, mental health in the US is BAD. 

1 in 5 US adults has received mental health care in the US & one third of all adults now report symptoms of depression or anxiety, 3x the number in 2019.

More and more research has come out showing the efficacy of group therapy for a wide range of mental health conditions like depression, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive and eating disorders.

Right now, group therapy makes up just 5% of private practice offerings with 95% going to individual therapy, but there are some huge benefits to the group modality.

On top of reducing stigma & decreasing loneliness for patients, group therapy would decrease strain on an increasing therapist shortage in our country, while also making mental care more affordable for consumers.


## Case 2: Building Block 2

Tech Career Path and Job Advice.
Primitives: Career, Technology Industry, Software Engineers

A platform for Software Engineers(ICs) to get career ladder training for their career progression. 

The number of software engineers has grown 185% and hit 2.3M in 2023. Despite all of this, software engineers don't have an industry standard to gauge their career progression.

Top: 0-1 employees making revenue on their company.

Jeff Bezos leveraged this largely ignored financial metric to grow Amazon into the BEHEMOTH it is today w/ <$10MM venture capital raised.

~Cash Conversion Cycle~ (CCC)

First, understand that there are 3 types of CCC scenarios for any biz:

1. Most common: You spend money (expenses) before you make money (revenues).

2. Unusual: You spend money at the same time that you make money.

3. The Holy Grail: You spend money AFTER you make money.

Unsurprisingly, Amazon falls into bucket #3.

They get cash from customers BEFORE they have to pay their suppliers.

This is called “negative cash conversion cycle”, and it’s the holy grail of cashflow.

When you pay your suppliers after you get paid by customers, you can use that short-term surplus of cash to reinvest back into growth.

And that’s exactly the reason Amazon was able to grow so fast with such little venture capital raised. It’s GENIUS.

So remember… the shorter your cash conversion cycle, the better.

Here’s how you can calculate it for your own business:

CCC = Days of Sales Outstanding + Days of Inventory Outstanding - Days of Payables Outstanding.


Exactly what problem will this solve? Value proposition.
For whom do we solve that problem? Target market.
How big is the opportunity? Market size.
How will we measure success? Metrics.
What alternatives are out there now? Competitive landscape.
Why are we best suited to pursue this? Unique differentiator.
Why now? Timing.
How will we get this product to market? Go-to-market strategy.
What factors are critical to success? Solution requirements.
