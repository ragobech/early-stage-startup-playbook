An early stage Startup Playbook

1) The Idea 
    Back to basics
     Why does the world need your product? Why should it exist?
     You can solve a problem for one person, create value, make a little money and go on your way.
     Why do you need to build a product or company?
     A good answer to this question is that the problem is so big enough that if it doesn't get solved, people die, get hurt or in pain. Why are you the one to solve? The good answer to this question and that you are the only one in this world that has the skills, ability and experience to do so. 

    We are similar but we are different.

    We are similar in the sense 

    We are different in that we priortize didfferent thigns
        - we want the world to 
        - we have certain kinks/nuances that allow us to see the world differently.

    - The Founder
        Why do Founders build products and start companies?
        It's one of the hardest journeys to go on: it's dangerous, loneley, stressful, emotional, most likely end up in failure or poor outcome. Could set you back finanncially.  But with all the doomsday scenarios, people still decide to go on the journey because they feel the world will be beffter off because of what value they can provide to the world.


    - Identifying Early Demand
    - The Proposition to Reality & Truth Gap
    Good:
        - Child Reading App
            - Problem: Efficacy of reading outcomes in children from 4-14 is low. Distractions, ipad, cause children to not read as much as they could as well as it is isolated.
            - 37M amount of children between ages 4 - 10 - in US
            - Established companies  -> Note of validation of  existing pain since other companies are trying to solve the same problem
            - What about your service that you do the best at that will motivate and encourage your demographic to use it?
            - Demand: 
            - Solution:

    Bad:
        - Lens filter app to socially filter information from the crowd
        - Problem: People make poor decisions and need the crowd to supplement their understanding and decisions
        - They limit perspective
        - XM have trouble filtering information and making a decision
        - Demand: 
        - Why now?

    - Market Timing
        There must be a reason why your product needs to exist today…right NOW. What is the current trend on why your product didn’t exist years ago and why now is the right time? What is it about NOW that makes things different? Is it the right time to be building this and why?
        What are the characteristics that make the timing climate the best for your product currently. Advanced technology? Unique insight?
    - Focus
        - Winning a small set of users and getting them to love your product is much better than getting a large number of users who somewhat like your product. By focusing,you can leverage the small set of users that you can relate to and conduct targeted research against them
        - Focus comes in 
        - The problem you’re solving
        - The people you’re targeting
        - Ie I’m building a finance tool for SaaS companies to automate payroll with no full-time Finance staff within the United States
        - you must do one thing really, really well. Otherwise, what are you doing?

    - Signal vs Noise
        - Signals tell you positive and negatives things about the information you need on what you're building
        - The Reality of the situation is data that you require to make full judgements about your business does not exist
        - Information and data will be incomplete, skewed, misprespsnative
        - What to do to get successful signals
    - Noise
        -  Be aware of what information is noise and does not matter ot what you're building...you can easily interpret a wrong fact or figure to negativitely influence your decisions
        -  Noise comes form possible competitors, etc.
    - The Minimal Viable Segments
    - Failing 

    Understanding of the "Market"
    - A Market is simply the aggregate of buyers and sellers. If you co-located everyone and everything in the world into one location and each station was selling a product/service, you would have all the markets in the world together.  But because the world is much more complex than this, there is a push and pull of market dynamics.
    - Markets 
    - It is much easier and simpler to take an existing market  and segment itThe market you choose to enter 

    Buyers
    - 


    Sellers
    - 



2) The Customer
    - Can you clearly articulate the problem that your customer has?
    - Who has the problem and how many people are there?
    - How are these people solving the problem today?
    - How superior is your product that will motivate them to switch?

2) The Product
    - Why build a product?
    - Product Market Fit vs Product Market Channel Fit
    - Iteration and Feedback Loops
    - Scarce resources
    - Failing 
    - The Hackers Mindset
        - A hackers mindset is a way of using creative solutions to solve problems. BEing persistent with the problem is . Redefining the problem in how to attack it, think of 
        - How do you hack this website?
    - Cohorts of users
        Cohorts are a good way to segment user bases around groups and time. Why people buy things in the last 3 months could dramatically be different in the next 3 months. It is important to segment buying behaviour into cohorts to understand trends and buying patterns to be able to predict and plan for the future
    - Net retention rate
    - Pricing Discovery
        - Cost Plus
        - Value Based

## Determining the value of your product to your potential customer
    - When you value something, you consider it important, worthwhile, something to possess
    - When people determine the value of your product/service it is in relation to the specific problem you are solving and the characteristics involved with it..in other words the WHY? Why is it valuable?
    - Does your product save people time? How much time? If people value their time, they will value the thing that protects and saves their time.
    - Time: Value - ratio - if you save me 1x time here, and I have the potential to generate 5x revenue by saving my time to do something that accomplishes Y, I value that
    - I find that related to the worth of my time plus the amount of potential reward. 

    - Value has a trigger
    - Value is relative
    - Value is subjective
    - Value is time-bound
    - Value has priority

    - Example: A bed is valuable. Provides comfort while I sleep.

    Trigger: I need to sleep every night.
    Sleeping on a nice comfy bed is highly valuable than going to a park. 
    Some people value different things about a mattress
    Time-bound: The value I put on my current bed is 2-3 yrs until I need to get a new one.
    Priority. I prioritize my sleep, as a result, I highly prioritize buying a valuable bed and de-prioritize other things.
     
3) The Company
    - Why build a company?
    - Building Companies are hard
    - Making Impact
    - Understanding your mission, vision and values
    - Getting people to buy into the vision
    - Building Teams 
        - Short-term vs Long-term
    - Team Formation 
    - Hiring
        - Where to find people 
    - Culture
    - Funding & Raising Money
    - The functions of a company
        - Customer 
        - Product
        - Revenue Generation
        - Sales
        - Operating Costs
    - Failing 

    What's the biggest problem you have that drives the most impact, that if solved will reduce the risk of failure?

# Your pathway to success
I hate to say it but your customers don't want your product. They never did. The fact that they have to come to your website, create their accounts, sign in...etc. It's a hassle. A product or service is a means to an end. Your customer or users just want to meet their goals or objectives. Many product builders and founders get caught up in how smart they think they are. At the end of the day, the customer/user just cares about getting a certain job done or achieving their goal. Help them do that in the most easiest and cost effective way possible and they will keep coming back.

In describing the value you can bring to your users and customers, you should change your vocabulary on how you reference and describe them.
At such an early stage your vaocabulyry should change to be within the customer context. For example:
- Fans want cheaper food and seats closer to their favourite player
- Instead of ....we're changing the seating arrangements in the stadium to have players closer to their fans.

Identify Small Experiment. Ship. Learn. Repeat.


# Your uniqueness and powers
- Document what makes you uniquely good at something and powers

- I am good at building early stage products and seeing things through.
- I like to think of ideas from scratch and see them to fruition.

# Keep it simple
- I always look at how we can simplify things, move fast, iterate, fail, learn and succeed.
- There are many wways to keep things simple ie:
1. Task A can take 8 hours to do but solve 80% of the problem
2. Task B can take 10 hours to do but solve 70% of the problem
3. Task C can take 24 horus to do but solve only 25% of the problem

## Using this Book
This book was written to provide people building products from nothing with a guide based on peoples experiences.

# Introduction
The pace of change in the world is occurring at an astromincal rate. The cost of building products and companies have reduced to merely peanuts. It has never been the best time to build a company. With that in mind, where does one begin? Many people have the aspiration to build a highly successful company but the reality is over 90% of companies fail.

I'm particulary interested in the advancement of human potential and condition. If we know something is going to fail. Let's fail at it fast so we can have people work on things that matter and help us progress as a human race. After all, one of the scarcest resources we have are time and money.

I provide you an introduction to what I feel is the best way to see the future. It is to experience and create it using your unique knowledge, experience and strengths. It is not enough to build something, it is to build it knowing you existed and particpiated in t 

But first we need to start with definitions 
Startups
- An experiment being done before product market fit

Product/Service
- 

## PMF
Success == Find qualified people that suffer from the problem your product solves and find enough value in YOUR product that they are willing to pay money to make their problem go away.

That's your target market and product market fit(PMF).


## What makes you unique?

If one had asked me that question early in my career, I would be lost for an answer.
- What are you uniquely good at?
- What are you exceptional at?
- What is the one thing in this world that you're the best at?


## Tough questions:

- Are you building something that someone wants?
- Are you building something that someone will pay for?
- Is there enough people willing to pay for your product/service to make it a sustainable business?
- Are you able to generate the product at a cost to make the business sustainable?
- Can someone else produce what you're doing as equal or better than you?
- Do you have a specific unfair advantage that protects you from competition? 
- Is your user adoption metrics predictable?
- Is your revenue predictable?



## What not to do
- Build things that people don't want
- Spend too much time building things without feedback from your end users
- Make assumptions about things without getting insights
- Spending too much time in your head 


Making High Quality Decisions fast and early.

1. Startups are hard because you are creating things from scratch that hasn't been done before and the path to doing so is not clear and straight forward.
2. Startups fail because the people operating and involved with them sometimes do not have the same goals, motivaitons and intentions
3. Inexperience in startups cause people to fail

   You should not start or work for a startup if:
    - You can't commit a large % of your time > 90% to the startup
    - Be incessently motivated to accomplish the mission of the company
    - If you just want a job to go to and from
    - Unable to learn fast and adapt 
    - Be able to deal with high pressure environments.
6. Uniquely well
    - What do you and your team possess that you feel only you can build?

Asking the right questions...

A good question, well formed can 

Here are some good an ddifficult questions:

- What about your product that do your potential customers not realize they need?
- 

# Ownership and Accountability
- You are kidding yourself if you ask somoene who didn't found the company and who doesn't have signifcant quity in the cmopany to care through a certain point about hte company
- In general people are professional enough to do what's reasonable to complete their job to stay employed
- It requires an incentive mechanism and founders to take the company to a different level


- ACCOUNTABILITY NETWORK
- What's the most important problem you have that you need to address with urgency?
- Sounding board to het advice ,information and guidance

Messaging
- How you talk matters
-


What I hope you get out of this book is a way to think about building great products that customers want that only you and your team can uniquely deliver. Let's begin!

## What Matters

1. That you can identify opportunities and execute on them
2. You will have successful and unsuccessful initiatives
    - Ensure the unsuccessful initiatives are short and do not kill your company
3. Experimentation is high / figure out what works and what doesn't
4. Operate with urgency - you do not know how long you will have to be in the game
5. Stay in the game
6. Demonstrate demand for the product 

## You should start or work for a startup if:
- Passionate about solving a problem and it won't be getting solved
- Identify a signficant gap in the market that you feel you and your team has the expertise to bridge

## Early founding skills
Do you have what it takes to start and build a company?

- Risk taking...sacrificing the present for the future pay off
- Going with ambiguity and unknowns
- Learning quickly
- Adapting to new situations
- Selling
- Telling a story
- Execution
- Strategic creativity
- Thinking critically
- Dealing with rejections
- Betting on yourself.


## The size of the opportunity
- is your idea worth pursuing?
- 

## When to shut a product down
- Your customer doesn't have the problem you think they have.
- It doesn't solve the problem your
- Low interest and demand
- Market timing
    - peoples priorities are different and it's on a lower rank
- Market is not big enough
- Not able to be profitable or it will take too long
- Run out of motivation

# Founders
- The individuals that build the company have a vision of the future. Building a product and business is a way to create the future. When you look at the successful founders of our generation, they possess a unique set of skills and characteristics that have driven them to success in their 
- A unique insight about a market, product, customer that fills a gap 
- Domain Expertise in the founder, why is this founder the right person to be solving this problem?
- For the future to become reality, a number of "Ands" must usually come to fruitiion in order for your successful outcome to materialize.
- Committment to their craft
- Being ahead of the game and your competition


## Types of Founders

- Legal Founder
- Product Founder
- Technical Founder
- Sales Founder
- People Founder

What you should be focused on as a founder
- getting the most insights about the idea
- selling to people
- doing what you can to invalidate the idea
- understanding what you're good at vs. what you're not good at.

I'm good at:

- Indie - Software Developer
- Management + Executive
- Writing
- Startups
- Early Stage Startups
- Entrepreneurship

It's only fitting that I've built a new startup and I'm writing about how to help others build startups.

Performance Based Projects
- Invalidate your idea in 30 days
- Identify your target market in 15 days


We try to do too many things as a founder, lack of identifying a concrete objective that matters and gets to the crux of the problem is a recipe for failure. In my opinion is better to take longer to get to a higher quality outcome than to take shortcuts and get to a lower quality outcome.


## What's next so - you have an idea that are convinced that works

- Test, Test, Test
Ways to test
1. Build a splash page with isgn up and get ads to drive people signing up
2. Reach out to your target market, offer them something of value and get to the bottom of your assumptions


- You know it when you know it..meeting product market-fit
- If you have to ask, you don't have PMF.


## Good reasons to start a business
- The world requires a solution in space to make it better off and you're able to fill that gap
- social impact 

## Bad reasons to start a business
- I want to make money
- ego or prestige
- lack of opportunities
- 


## Urgency vs Importance


## Speed of Learning



## Who to target
- early adopters
- are people who are likely to try and experiment with new things
- things don't need to be perfect
- innovators
- like to be on the cutting edge 

## Where to find these people
- reddit
- communities

Day 0
- The first days of product building has the founders passionately researching, communicating, 

Day 1
- The first days of product building has the founders passionately researching, communicating, protoyphing, talking to people on the new idea that they just discovered. The optimism that flows in this phase is like eupohoria. You suddenly discovered the "Solution" to solve all of lifes problems and if only you build it as soon as possible and get it to market, you will be a king and make a lot of money.
- Suddently after the first initial thoughts, those ambitions start coming back to earth and reality sits in.


The early days

TL;DR: Build things that customers want, better than anyone else. 

Bet on technical insights that help solve a big problem in a novel way that yields a superior product with business profitability.

Founders
